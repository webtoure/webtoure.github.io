        <h2>Quiz Engine Pro <sup>*</sup></h2>
        <span class="entry-date">2015-08-26</span>
        <p>I have been working on and off for the last couple of weeks on a WordPress plugin which emulates BuzzFeed's quizzes. I should emphasize that there are a lot of variations that BuzzFeed's quizzes have and which would take significant work to replicate. This version that I am working on is just the basic functionality that I hope and believe still manages to capture the essence of the original.</p>
        <p>As far as development goes, I have allocated a big chunk of the time to backend development and what happened is that the frontend is severely lagging behind at this point. There are simply <strong>tons</strong> of features I would like to add but I should definitely focus on bringing something to the table first and then gradually add more cool stuff to it.</p>
        <aside class="note"><p><sup>*</sup> Initially this post was titled <em>Quiz Engine Pro or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Enjoy Coding</em>. I have removed the last part from the title because this entry was supposed to be detailing a few obstacles that I have hit which would take quite some time to document. I would definitely like to come back at some point and add the missing information.</p></aside>
